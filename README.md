<h1>Sales & Financial Performance Dashboard â€“ AtliQ Hardware</h1>

 ### [Excel Dashboard ](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/1c83qhE6eVta5_0hIwPuW9__H-YTLHZdJ)

<h2>Description</h2>
I built an automated and interactive Excel dashboard to analyze three years of sales and financial data (2019â€“2021) for AtliQ Hardware, a global electronics company.

The objective was to uncover key business insightsâ€”such as top-performing products, regions, and customersâ€”and track financial KPIs like net sales, gross margin, and profitability trends.

Using Power Query, I automated the cleaning and transformation of raw transactional data. I used PivotTables, charts, conditional formatting, and slicers to create a dynamic, user-friendly dashboard that enables stakeholders to filter by region, year, division, and customer.

This project demonstrated my ability to turn raw data into actionable insights and build executive-ready reports that support strategic decisions.
